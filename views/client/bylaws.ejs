        <span class="bylaw-elections">Elections</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        Once every 2 quarters, if there is a vacancy in one of the above officer
        positions, an election will be held to fill that spot. To be a
        candidate, one must have come to 70% of the meetings for 2 consecutive
        quarters prior to the election. To be able to vote during this election,
        one must have come to at least 40% of the meetings for 2 consecutive
        quarters prior to the election. If you are currently holding an Officer
        position and want to occupy the vacant spot, you are also able to run as
        a candidate; if you lose, you are able to return to your previous
        Officer position, and if you win, you must occupy your new Officer
        position for at least 2 quarters before running for another position.
        <br />
        <br />
        Candidates will answer foreign affairs-related questions with the
        school’s buzzer-beater system and give speeches. The winner of the
        “quizbowl” will be awarded 1 vote, and the overall winner will be
        determined by popular vote.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="bylaw-challenges">Challenges</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        Once every 2 quarters (not coinciding with elections), any officer is
        able to be challenged for their position. To be able to challenge an
        officer, one must have come to 90% of the meetings for 2 consecutive
        quarters prior to the challenging and displayed active and appropriate
        participation in those meetings. The current officer and the challenger
        will engage in a short trivia contest and will be asked foreign
        affairs-related questions by the president(and other staff members) and
        will be giving speeches as well. The winner of the trivia contestant
        will be awarded 1 vote. People who have come to at least 40% of the
        meetings for 2 consecutive quarters prior to the challenge, are able to
        vote. Officers can only be challenged after they’ve occupied their
        position for a minimum of 2 school quarters, and are able to be
        challenged a maximum of two times by the same person. An officer is able
        to challenge another officer.
        <br />
        <br />
        The President is only able to be challenged after they’ve been in office
        for 2 years, and the opportunity to challenge the President is available
        once every 2 quarters. Anyone can challenge the President, as long as he
        or she has come to 90% of the meetings for 2 consecutive years, as well
        as having occpuied an officer position for at least 2 consecutive
        quarters. There will be a trivia contest as well, and the other officers
        will be asking the questions. The winner of the “quizbowl” will be
        awarded 1 vote.

        <span class="bylaw-officer-rules">Officer Rules</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are a staff member and fail to come to at least 70% of the
        meetings for 2 consecutive quarters, you will be demoted to the status
        of “member,” and will be forced to vacate your Office position
        immediately; the 30% of absences must be excused.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="bylaw-member-information">Member Information</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        To be a member, one must come to at least 30% of the meetings for 1
        school year, and members are able to write this on his or her college
        transcript. This is commonly known as "club credit”; do not lie about
        being a member, since the guidance department will confirm your activity
        with the club advisor and secretary. Keep in mind that just coming for a
        few minutes does not qualify as attending the meeting (unless you have
        after school sports/makeup tests); you must stay for at least 15-30
        minutes.
